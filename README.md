## Netflix Clone Using TMDB API 

A Netflix-inspired web application developed using React.js that fetches movie and TV show data from the TMDB API, offering users a streamlined platform for content exploration.

Here are some additional details about the website:

â€¢ Seamless integration with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, providing real-time access to an extensive collection of movie and TV show information.

â€¢ Utilizes React's component-based architecture and CSS Flexbox/Grid to achieve a responsive and visually appealing user interface, ensuring optimal presentation across various screen sizes.

â€¢ Displays a dynamic array of movie and TV show posters, each linked to its respective detailed information fetched from the TMDB API.

â€¢ Offers users the option to view trailers for movies and TV shows using embedded video components like react-youtube and movie-trailers.

Will try to add more functionality in coming days.
